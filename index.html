				I was born and raised in San Diego, and lived here my whole life.  I graduated from UCSD in 2001 with a degree in Biochemistry and Cell Biology.  I've always been interested in Science and Technology, and have worked as a Biochemist in various laboratory positions in the Biotech industry for the past 16 years.  I have a very analytical mindset combined with a creative side , which is what drew me towards the field of Web Development.  I decided to take my interest to a whole new level by enrolling in the Coding Bootcamp at UCSD Extension.  I'm excited about eventually making a career change to becoming a software developer.  I am looking for a Junior Development role with a small to medium-sized company with room for growth.  I am planning on continuing my study of web development and gaining additional programming skills.
